 <h1>India’s Wind Power Sector Falls Behind Other Countries </h1>



    <p class="hej">Until recent years, India used to be one of the leading countries in the world in regards to wind power. However, the country saw its biggest decline in annual wind power generated this year with a 26 percent drop since the same time in 2021. </p>
    
    <p class="hej">
        The Indian government had originally planned to reach 39.48 GW wind power capacity in 2022 making it the fourth highest wind power in the world. Today, it is at barely 18 GW which ultimately hurts India’s plan to decarbonise its energy sector.
        </p>

        <p class="hej">

            According to the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) in a recent parliament panel, there are several reasons for the decline. Firstly, the country experienced a shift in weather patterns which caused the southern regions to get less wind and hence less wind power at wind farms. Secondly, fewer wind power farms were built in 2021 and 2022 compared to previous years, because “presently the wind power projects in the country are installed on the basis of commercial viability through tariff-based competitive bidding process.”  

        </p>

        <p class="hej">
            The report noted that in order to improve India’s wind power sector for the coming years, regular bids for wind energy projects need to be issued. In addition, it is equally important for public sector organizations and the wind industry to invest in climatological research and modeling in order to develop better weather forecasting techniques and cost-efficient support services. These interventions are becoming increasingly important as climate change is expected to cause more anomalies in wind speeds and patterns in coming years
